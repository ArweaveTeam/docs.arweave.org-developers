# Arweave Deploy

## Installation

### NPM

Arweave Deploy is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) CLI applicaiton, so it can be installed and updated using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) \(Node Package Manager\). NPM is automatically installed as part of Node.js.

Node 10+ is recommended as it's the latest LTS version and has native support for some RSA encryption functions which are not available in preivous versios.

#### Installation

```text
npm install -g arweave-deploy
```

The `-g` flag installs the package globally so you can access it from any directory.

### Binaries

If you dont have or want to install Node.js, have an incompatible version, or using NPM isn't suitable, then you can download one of the precompiled binaries which can be run directly.
